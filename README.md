# Bosch-Production-Line-Performance
Bosch, one of the world's leading manufacturing companies, has an imperative to ensure that the recipes for the production of its advanced mechanical components are of the highest quality and safety standards. Part of doing so is closely monitoring its parts as they progress through the manufacturing processes. Because Bosch records data at every step along its assembly lines, they have the ability to apply advanced analytics to improve these manufacturing processes. However, the intricacies of the data and complexities of the production line pose problems for current methods. To predict internal failures using thousands of measurements and tests made for each component along the assembly line. This would enable Bosch to bring quality products at lower costs to the end user.
